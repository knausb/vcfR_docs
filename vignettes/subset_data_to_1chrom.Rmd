The functions in vcfR are designed to work on a single chromosome.
Many genomes don't actually have chromosomes but instead have supercontigs or contigs.
Here I use the terms chromosome, supercontig and contig as synonyms.
They make for a nice way to subset genomic data to a smaller unit, and this unit as a convenient coordinant system.
Depending on the organisation of your data, you may have to subset some of your files before you can use them in vcfR.
Here I demontrate how I accomplish this.


## Subsetting a FASTA file to one chromosome


A FASTA file for a genome typically consists of many sequences (chromosomes, supercontigs, contigs, etc.).
Typically these can be read into R and subset within R.
We can use the function `read.dna()` from the package 'ape' to read in our FASTA to an object of class DNAbin.
We can then subset this object to a single sequence with the function `grep()` and a regular expression.
More information on these topics can be found within R with `?grep` and `?"regular expression"`



```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ape)
dna <- read.dna("pinf_super_contigs.fa", format = "fasta")
dna2 <- dna[ grep( "Supercontig_1.1 ", names(dna) ) ]
names(dna2) <- "Supercontig_1.1"
dna2 <- as.matrix(dna2)
```


Using this example (with your FASTA file name and chromosome name) should result in an object of class DNAbin that consists of a single sequence.


## Subsetting a GFF file


Annotation files can be easily subset as well.
A GFF file is simply a tabular file with the chromosome in the first column.
This can also be subset with a regular expression.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
gff <- read.table('gff_file.gff', sep="\t", quote="")
gff2 <- gff[grep("Supercontig_1.1", gff[,1]),]
```


## Subsetting a VCF file

I personally like to call variants on a per chromosome basis and send each chromosome as a seperate job to our SGE system.
The genome I currently work on has about 5,000 supercontigs.
This means I create about 5,000 jobs and therefore split the task of variant calling into many smaller jobs.
This results one chromosome per VCF file and means I do not have to subset my VCF files.


You may have to subset your VCF file.
(Okay, I do too sometimes.)
I suggest you do this outside of R because you may not have enough memory to read the entire file into memory.
In a Unix environment this can be accomplished at the command line.


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
grep "^#" my_variants.vcf > header.vcf # Meta
grep "^Supercontig_1.1" my_variants.vcf > tmp.vcf # Body
cat header.vcf tmp.vcf > sc1.vcf
```


This could also be accomplished with [VCFtools](https://vcftools.github.io/) (which may help Windows users as well).


## VcfR


You should now be able to import your VCF data with vcfR and create chromR objects.


```{r create.chromR, eval=FALSE}
library(vcfR)
vcf <- read.vcfR("sc1.vcf")
chrom <- create.chromR(name='Supercontig', vcf=vcf, seq=dna2, ann=gff2)
```
